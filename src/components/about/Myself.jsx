      <h2 className={styles.title}>From Healthcare to Coding: My Journey</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        For years, I worked in the medical field, caring for people and
        contributing to their well-being. However, deep down, I felt something
        was missing—I wasn't truly fulfilled. While my job had a meaningful
        impact, I longed for a career where I could create, build things from
        scratch, and use my problem-solving skills in a different way.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        That's when I discovered programming. Out of curiosity, I started
        learning the basics, and to my surprise, I absolutely loved coding. It
        gave me the satisfaction I was looking for—the ability to solve
        problems, think logically, and bring ideas to life through technology.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        To make a solid transition, I enrolled in a Computer Science degree and
        took specialized courses. I started with a Java programming course,
        where I learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, and
        then moved on to a Full Stack development course, which gave me a
        broader perspective on web development, from frontend to backend.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Now, I am fully committed to this career change and eager to grow in
        this field. I love learning new technologies, building projects, and
        challenging myself with complex problems. Coding is not just a new
        career path for me — it's a passion that I'm determined to turn into a
        reality
